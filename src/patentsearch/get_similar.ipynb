      "1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates in general to frequency modulation measurement and more particularly to a novel method and apparatus for accurately testing and adjusting the modulation sensitivity and, hence, the frequency deviation of frequency modulated radio frequency generators. 2. Description of the Prior Art A technique for measuring the frequency deviation of a frequency-modulated generator is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,071,726, issued Jan. 1, 1963, inventor B. E. Nelson, in which the Bessel zero or carrier null technique is disclosed. This technique is based on the fact that the RF carrier voltage amplitude goes to zero when the frequency modulation index equals 2.405. The modulation index is defined as M.sub.f = .DELTA.f/f.sub.s where .DELTA.f is the peak frequency deviation; and f.sub.s is the modulation frequency. At the carrier null condition .DELTA.f/f.sub.s = 2.405. The amplitude of the modulation frequency is increased from zero amplitude to an amplitude at which the carrier shrinks to zero amplitude thereby making the modulation index M.sub.f equal to 2.405. By measuring the amplitude V.sub.s of the modulation frequency f.sub.s at the carrier null condition, the modulation sensitivity .DELTA.f/V.sub.s of the frequency modulator is determined. Such a technique, as is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,071,726, requires the use of a modulation frequency having an adjustable amplitude so as to drive the RF carrier voltage to zero and, also, requires some device for measuring the RF carrier output voltage during the measurement period, thus, separate expensive test equipment is required to implement this technique. Another frequency deviation measuring system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,549,997, issued Dec. 22, 1970, inventor D. Rotzel, wherein a frequency modulated signal and a reference signal are separately used to derive zero crossing pulses which are separately coupled to counters via gates. The frequency modulated signal is additionally coupled to a pulse shaper via a discriminator which generates a pulse which opens the gates to initiate counting. Each gate is separately closed by its associated counter when a predetermined count is reached for that counter. The time elapsing between the closing of the respective gates is a measure of the frequency deviation. The time is measured by coupling the gate closing signals via an Exclusive-OR gate to another gate which allows pulses from a timing pulse generator to reach a direct reading counter. One problem with this technique is that the time measurement will vary depending upon whether the frequency modulated signal is started during its positive half-cycle when its frequency will be greater than that of the reference frequency, or whether it is started during the negative half-cycle when its frequency will be less than the reference frequency. In order to reduce the effects of the short time fluctuations, the deviation must be determined by taking an average value of the measurements. For a frequency modulation system including a frequency modulator, an automatic frequency control circuit and a measuring device connected therein, a technique for testing and adjusting the frequency deviation of the frequency modulator comprising; applying to an input of the frequency modulator a calibrated deviation signal which shifts the output frequency of the frequency modulator a predetermined amount when the modulation sensitivity is properly adjusted; applying the frequency modulated output to a frequency shifter which shifts the output frequency by said predetermined amount but in a direction opposite from that caused by the calibrated deviation signal; and, applying the frequency shifted signal to the automatic frequency control circuit. If the modulation sensitivity of the frequency modulator is correctly adjusted, the measuring device should give the same indication during the test as it did during the normal operation, e.g., carrier output only. Otherwise, the measuring device will give a different indication. In this latter case, the modulation sensitivity of the frequency modulator is adjusted until both the normal indication and the indication during test are substantially the same.\n",

COPYRIGHT NOTICE A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains or may contain material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the photocopy reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure in exactly the form it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. The present invention relates in general to a central determination gaming system, and more particularly to a central determination gaming system which provides a player a choice in outcomes. The majority of the contemporary wagering gaming devices or gaming terminals, such as slot machines, randomly generate awards and other outcomes. Such gaming terminals typically include a relatively low probability associated with obtaining the highest award, relatively medium probabilities associated with obtaining medium range awards and relatively higher probabilities associated with obtaining low range awards. These gaming terminals also include probabilities associated with obtaining losses or no award at all. The probabilities of obtaining the awards and the amount of the awards determine the average expected pay out percentage of these wagering gaming terminals. Because the outcomes of these gaming terminals are completely randomly determined, there is no certainty that a player will ever obtain any particular award. That is, no matter how many times a player plays the game, since the gaming terminal generates outcomes randomly or completely based upon a probability calculation, there is no certainty that the game will ever provide the player with a rare outcome, such as a jackpot award, or any other specific value for that matter. On the other hand, due to the random determination, the gaming terminal can provide the rare outcomes, such as jackpot awards, numerous times in a small number of plays. For example, a probability-based $1 slot machine gaming terminal may be programmed to payback 95% of all wagers placed with a 1% chance of generating a $10 win outcome, a 5% chance of generating a $5 win outcome, a 10% chance of generating a $2 win outcome, a 40% chance of generating a $1 win outcome and a 44% chance of generating a $0 loss outcome. However, when one hundred game outcomes are generated by the probability-based slot machine gaming terminal, the actual payback may be 137% of all wagers placed and the actual generated outcomes may be six $10 win outcomes, one $5 win outcome, eighteen $2 win outcomes, thirty-six $1 win outcomes and thirty-nine $0 loss outcomes. This uncertainty is faced by players and casinos or other gaming establishments. For example, certain casinos prefer that a relatively high number of players hit low awards while a relatively low number of players hit high awards. When players hit high awards periodically, casinos attract more players, because of the positive publicity large wins generate. By using desired payback percentages or probabilities, the casinos can also expect to make a certain level of profit. The random determinations can, however, unexpectedly cause casinos to suffer a loss or, on the other hand, to reap great profit in the short run and lose business in the long run due to a reputation for only paying out low awards. Regulatory bodies in certain jurisdictions do not permit the use of probability-based gaming terminals in-part for these reasons. These regulatory bodies permit the use of wagering gaming terminals which are guaranteed to provide certain or definite awards, so that, for example, a certain number of wins is guaranteed and the overall amount paid back to players is guaranteed. That is, the payback percentage is fixed and not an average expected amount. One type of gaming terminal which complies with this requirement is an instant-type lottery gaming terminal. An instant-type lottery gaming terminal includes a finite pool or set of electronic tickets with each electronic ticket assigned to a predetermined outcome. Alternatively, each electronic ticket could be assigned to a random number or game play seed. Each seed is deterministic of a predetermined outcome. That is, the gaming terminal utilizes the random number or game play seed in a random number generating algorithm to generate random numbers that the gaming terminal then uses to determine and provide the predetermined outcome. In an instant-type lottery gaming terminal, as the predetermined outcome for each electronic ticket is revealed to a player on the gaming terminal, the ticket is removed (i.e., flagged as used) from the finite pool or set of electronic tickets. Once removed from the pool or set, a ticket cannot be used again to determine another game outcome. This type of gaming terminal provides players with all of the available outcomes over the course of the play cycle and guarantees the actual wins and losses. Since an instant-type lottery gaming machine has a finite pool of predetermined win/loss outcomes, it is possible to configure the pool to specific conditions or criteria requested by the casino or gaming establishment. An example of these conditions or criteria are the number of tickets included in the pool and the exact payback percentage or payback sum for the pool as a whole. The payback percentage or sum represents the guaranteed payout for the entire pool of predetermined outcomes. Other examples of conditions or criteria are what prizes will be awarded and the frequency of winning outcome tickets amongst the total number of tickets for the pool. For example, if a predetermined pool includes twenty $1 tickets and the pool has a payback sum of $10, then the pool might consist of one $5 win outcome, one $2 win outcome, three $1 win outcomes and fifteen $0 loss outcomes and may be represented as the following outcomes: 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. It should be appreciated that the above described pool of twenty tickets is for illustration purposes only and a pool could include any suitable desired number of tickets including a large number such as one million or more. Even though a pool may contain more than one of the same game outcome (i.e., the loss or the win and if a win, the value), the presentation to the player (such as reel stops in the case of slot machines or simulated slot machines, cards dealt or drawn in the case of simulated card games and the like) is preferably varied for each sequential game outcome. For example, in the twenty ticket pool described above, while three game outcomes may each determine a win game outcome with a value of $1, in a slot machine type game each game outcome will be preferably presented to the player as multiple different or all different winning combinations of reel symbols. Central determination gaming systems are also generally known. A central determination gaming system provides a plurality of individual gaming terminals, located in a gaming establishment, such as a casino, coupled by one or more communication links, to a central processor or controller. When a player plays a game on one of the gaming terminals, a game outcome is randomly generated based on probability data by the central controller. The generated game outcome and how the game outcome is to be presented or displayed to the player are communicated from the central controller to the individual gaming terminal and then provided to the player. It should be appreciated that one central processor may continuously run hundreds or thousands of individual gaming terminals at once. Additionally, each individual gaming terminal may include a plurality of different types of games played at a plurality of different denominations. In order to comply with the above mentioned regulatory rules that do not permit the use of probability-based gaming terminals, central determination gaming systems have been implemented wherein the central system maintains one or more predetermined pools or sets of game outcomes. Each game outcome in each set or pool includes a game outcome component (i.e., a win, a lose, a secondary game trigger or other suitable outcome) with an associated value or payout amount, if any, and a game presentation component (i.e., how the game outcome is displayed or presented to the player). In these systems, when a player makes a wager on one of the gaming devices, the central system independently selects a game outcome from a set or pool of game outcomes and flags or marks the selected game outcome as used. Once a game outcome is flagged as used, it is prevented from further selection from the set or pool and cannot be selected by the central controller upon another wager. The selected game outcome is communicated to the individual gaming terminal. The individual gaming terminal displays or presents the game presentation component and provides the player the game outcome component with the associated value, if any, for the selected game outcome. Additionally, certain central determination gaming systems have also been implemented wherein the central system maintains one or more predetermined pools or sets of random number or game outcome seeds. There are a number of advantages to providing for centralized production of game outcomes at individual gaming terminals. Central production or control can assist a casino or other entity in maintaining appropriate records, controlling gaming, reducing and preventing cheating or electronic or other errors, reducing or eliminating win-loss volatility and the like. However, it should be appreciated that existing central determination gaming systems involve minimal to no player interaction other than initiating a game play at a gaming terminal. That is, similar to an instant type lottery game, the central controller selects a game outcome from the pool and the selected game outcome is provided to the player with the player unable to influence the provided game outcome. Therefore, the need exists for a central determination gaming system that provides an increases level of player interaction in the determination of the outcome provided to the player. Gaming devices having a primary or base game and a secondary or a bonus game are also well known. A secondary or bonus game may be any type of suitable game, either similar to or completely different from the primary game, which is entered upon the occurrence of a triggering event or a selected outcome in the primary game. The secondary or bonus game enables the player to obtain a prize or payout in addition to the prize or payout, if any, obtained from the primary game. A secondary or bonus game produces a significantly higher level of player excitement than the primary game because it provides a greater expectation of winning than the primary game and is accompanied with more attractive or unusual features than the primary game. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a central determination gaming system which provides a player a choice which results in one of a plurality of outcomes. In one embodiment of the present invention, upon a player initiating a game play at one of a plurality of gaming terminals in communication with a central controller, the central controller selects a plurality of game outcomes from a pool or set of predetermined game outcomes. The initiated game provides the player at least one and preferably a plurality of choices or decisions during game play. In one embodiment, the number of game outcomes selected is equal to the number of different choices that a player could possibly make during game play. That is, each game outcome corresponds with a different choice or decision the player may make concerning the play of the game and the player is provided one of the selected game outcomes based on the choice or decision the player makes. In one embodiment, a plurality of the game outcomes the player may possibly be provided are different. In another embodiment, all of the game outcomes the player may possibly be provided are different. For example, if the initiated game provides a choice of four different options for the player to decide from (i.e., a choice between four different player selectable selections), then the central controller selects four game outcomes from the pool of game outcomes. In another embodiment, the number of game outcomes selected is less then the number of different choices the player could make during the play of the game. In this embodiment, at least one game outcome will be associated with more than one player choice. Each game outcome includes an outcome component, such as a win, a lose, a secondary game triggering or other suitable outcome, with an associated value or pay amount, if any. Each game outcome may also include, based on the specific game played on the gaming terminal, a presentation component. A presentation component is how the game outcome is presented or displayed to the player, such as a reel symbol combination of a slot machine or a hand of cards dealt in a card game. The central controller marks or flags each selected game outcome in the pool as used or unavailable. Once a game outcome is marked or flagged it is prevented from a subsequent selection from the pool upon another game play. It should be appreciated that if the mark or flag is removed from a game outcome, that game outcome is again available to be selected from the pool during a subsequent selection. The central controller communicates the selected game outcomes to the requesting gaming terminal. Upon receiving the plurality of selected game outcomes, in one embodiment, the gaming terminal associates each selected game outcome with a different choice or decision the player can make during play of the initiated game. In another embodiment, each selected game outcome is already associated (by the central controller or other suitable method) with a different choice or decision the player can make during play of the initiated game. The gaming terminal enables the player to make at least one choice or decision regarding the play of the initiated game. In another embodiment, the gaming terminal enables the player to make a plurality of choices or decisions regarding the play of the initiated game. After the player makes at least one choice or decision, the gaming terminal determines the game outcome that corresponds with the player's choice or decision. The gaming terminal then provides the player one of the selected game outcomes based on the player's choice or decision. That is, the player's choice or decision during the course of game play directly relates to the game outcome ultimately provided to the player. If the game outcome is a win or a lose outcome, the gaming terminal provides the associated value or payout amount, if any, to the player and the game play ends. If the game outcome is a secondary game trigger, the gaming terminal provides the associated value or payout amount, if any, to the player and the gaming terminal enables the player to play at least one secondary game. After the gaming terminal provides the player a game outcome that is based on the player's choice or decision, the gaming terminal communicates to the central controller which game outcome was provided to the player and/or which game outcome(s) were not provided to the player. That is, since the central determination gaming system of the present invention provides all of the game outcomes from the pool of game outcomes over the course of the play cycle and the selected non-provided game outcomes are flagged as unavailable, it is necessary for the gaming terminal to communicate to the central controller which game outcome was provided to the player and/or which game outcome(s) were not used or provided to the player in order for the central controller to insure that the selected non-provided game outcomes are once again available to be subsequently provided to a player. In one embodiment, the gaming terminal communicates each of the remaining non-provided game outcomes back to the central controller. In this embodiment, the central controller removes the mark or flag from each returned game outcome, thereby enabling the returned game outcomes to be selected and communicated to a gaming terminal in a subsequent game play. In another embodiment, the gaming terminal communicates to the central controller information or data concerning which game outcome was provided to the player and/or which game outcome(s) were not used or provided to the player. In this embodiment, the central controller removes the mark or flag on each game outcome not provided to the player, thereby enabling the non-provided game outcomes to be selected and communicated to a gaming terminal in a subsequent game play. In an alternative embodiment, the non-provided game outcomes are retained by the gaming terminal and not returned to the central controller. In this embodiment, the plurality of selected game outcomes communicated from the central controller are stored in a cache or memory device of the gaming terminal. Upon a player initiating a game play, the gaming terminal requests a number of game outcomes, if any, based on the number of game outcomes currently in the cache and the number of game outcomes needed to play the game. After the central controller selects, flags and communicates the needed number of game outcomes, the communicated game outcomes are added to the cache. The gaming terminal then selects a plurality of game outcomes from the cache and associates the selected game outcomes with the plurality of choices or decisions that could be made during the game play. This embodiment proceeds as described above, however after a game outcome is provided to the player based on the player's choice or decision during the game play, the gaming terminal removes the provided game outcome from the cache or memory device and retains the non-provided game outcomes in the cache or memory device. Upon a player initiating a subsequent game at the gaming terminal, if needed, the central controller communicates a new game outcome request to the central controller. In one embodiment illustrating the present invention in a slot machine gaming terminal, upon a player initiating a game play, the reels begin to spin. While the reels are spinning, the central controller selects a plurality of game outcomes, flags the plurality of selected game outcomes as unavailable and communicates the plurality of selected game outcomes to the gaming terminal as described above. It should be appreciated that in this embodiment, each game outcome in the pool of game outcomes has an associated presentation component. That is, each game outcome is associated with a specific reel symbol combination to be displayed or presented to the player if that game outcome is provided to the player. Upon receiving the plurality of selected game outcomes, the gaming terminal associates each received game outcome with a different choice or decision the player could possibly make during the play of the slot game. The gaming terminal then enables the player to make at least one choice or decision concerning the play of the slot game. For example, the gaming terminal enables the player to choose or decide when to stop the reels from spinning, wherein when the player decides to stop the reels is associated with one of the selected game outcomes. It should be appreciated that the gaming terminal or central controller is operable to associate the plurality of selected game outcomes with any other suitable plurality of choices or decisions the player could possibly make concerning the play of the slot game. For instance, the gaming terminal or central controller may associate the plurality of selected game outcomes with the plurality of choices or decisions the player could possibly make in a strategy bonus game. After the player has made at least one choice or decision regarding the play of the slot game, the gaming terminal provides the player with the selected game outcome associated with the player's choice or decision. For example, if the gaming terminal had associated a win $2 game outcome with the player's choice or decision to stop the reels after spinning for between 1.5 and 2.0 seconds and the player decided to stop the reels after 1.8 seconds, then the gaming terminal would provide the player the associated win $2 game outcome and display the appropriate presentation of reel symbol combinations for the provided game outcome. It should be appreciated that through the use of an appropriate pay table for the specific game played, the presentation component for each game outcome corresponds to the outcome component and associated value, if any, for that game outcome. The gaming terminal communicates to the central controller which selected game outcome was provided/not provided in order for the central controller to remove the flag from the non-provided selected game outcomes as described above. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the gaming terminal offers the player an initial game outcome and enables the player to make at least one choice or decision that may modify the initial game outcome. In this embodiment, upon the initiation of a game at a gaming terminal, the central controller selects one game outcome from the pool of game outcomes and designates the selected game outcome as an initial game outcome. The initial game outcome represents the game outcome that the player will base his choice(s) or decision(s) on. For example, the initial outcome may be the initial hand of cards dealt to the player. The central controller then selects a plurality of potential game outcome that could be obtained based on the choice(s) or decision(s) the player makes in respect to the initial game outcome. It should be appreciated that a plurality of the potential game outcomes are associated with or correspond to the plurality of choices or decisions the player can possibly make during the play of the game based on the initial outcome. After selecting the initial game outcome and the plurality of potential game outcomes, the central controller flags each selected game outcome and communicates each selected game outcome to the gaming terminal as described above. The gaming terminal offers the player the designated initial game outcome and enables the player to make at least one choice or decision regarding the play of the initial game outcome. The player's choice or decision determines the game outcome that will be provided to the player. If the player is satisfied with the offered initial game outcome, then the player is provided the initial game outcome and not one of the plurality of potential game outcomes. In this case, the game outcome ultimately provided to the player (the initial game outcome) is still based on the player's choice or decision (the decision to accept the initial game outcome). In one embodiment illustrating a poker style gaming terminal, the central controller selects a game outcome from the pool or set of game outcomes and designates the selected game outcome as the initial game outcome. The central controller then selects thirty-one game outcomes from the pool or set and designates these selected game outcomes as potential game outcomes. The thirty-one potential game outcomes are associated with the thirty-one different outcomes that can possibly be obtained from the initial game outcome based on the player's decision to discard at least one card. For instance, one selected potential game outcome may be a win $2 game outcome that the player obtains if the player holds the first, third and fifth card and discards the second and fourth cards for new cards, while another selected potential game outcome may be a lose or $0 game outcome that the player obtains if the player holds the second, third and fourth card and discards the first and fifth card for new cards. The initial game outcome is associated with the game outcome that will be obtained if the player is satisfied with the initial game outcome and decides to hold each card. That is, the thirty-one potential game outcomes coupled with the initial game outcome represent the thirty-two different game outcomes that can possibly be obtained based on the player's decision of how to play the initial game outcome offered to the player (the five cards that are initially dealt). It should be appreciated that the game presentation component of a plurality of the potential game outcomes are each related to the game outcome presentation of the initial game outcome. That is, the game presentation component for the potential game outcome associated with the player holding the second, third and fourth cards of the initial game outcome (i.e., the initial poker hand), will include the same second, third and fourth cards as the game presentation component of the initial game outcome. In this embodiment, the central controller flags the plurality of selected game outcomes (the initial game outcome and the plurality of potential game outcomes) and communicates the plurality of selected game outcomes to the central controller as described above. Upon receiving the selected game outcomes, the gaming terminal offers the initial game outcome to the player (i.e., displays five cards in a poker style game). The gaming terminal then enables the player to make at least one and preferable a plurality of choices regarding the initial game outcome offered to the player. For example, the gaming terminal enables the player to hold or discard each presented card. Depending on the player's choice concerning the play of the game, (i.e., which cards the player decides to hold or discard), the gaming terminal selects the potential game outcome that is associated with the choice or decision the player made. The gaming terminal provides the player the game outcome associated with the player's choice or decision. For example, if the player choose to discard the fourth and fifth cards, then the gaming terminal would provide the player a win $1 game outcome that is associated with the player discarding the fourth and fifth cards. If the player's choice is not to discard any cards but to hold each of the cards initially dealt, then the initial game outcome is provided to the player. It should be appreciated that the presentation of the provided game outcome may be similar to the presentation of the initial game outcome. That is, if the player decided to hold the first, second and third cards and discard the fourth and fifth cards, then the provided game outcome will be presented to the player with the same first, second and third cards as the initial game outcome. After the gaming terminal provides the player a game outcome that is based on the player's decision, the gaming terminal communicates which game outcomes were provided/not provided to the central controller, as described above, to enable the non-provided game outcomes to be reselected and communicated to a gaming terminal in a subsequent game play. It should be appreciated that the above described embodiments of the present invention can also be implemented with a pool of game outcome seeds. Each game outcome seed is a unique random number seed which is deterministic of a game outcome, such as a win outcome, a lose outcome or a secondary or bonus game triggering outcome. In this embodiment, the central controller selects, flags and communicates a plurality of game outcome seeds to the gaming terminal in an identical fashion to the central controller selecting, flagging and communicating a plurality of game outcomes as described above. Upon receiving the plurality of game outcome seeds, the gaming terminal utilizes the selected game outcome seeds in a random number generating algorithm to generate at least one and preferably a plurality of random numbers. The gaming terminal then uses the generated random numbers to determine the game outcome which each game outcome seed is deterministic of. The plurality of determined game outcomes are then associated with the plurality choices or decisions available to the player and the game proceeds as described above. The present invention provides a number of advantages over existing central determination gaming systems. For example, since the gaming terminals of the present invention enable the player to make a choice or decision about the ultimate game outcome that they will receive, the present invention includes an aspect of player interaction and player involvement for central determination gaming systems. That is, the present invention complies with certain regulations that require that a central controller maintains a pool of predetermined game outcomes (which guarantees a specific amount of actual wins and losses), while also providing the player a level of control over the play of the game. This increases the player's level of excitement and enjoyment. Additional features and advantages of the present invention are described in, and will be apparent from, the following Detailed Description of the Invention and the figures.\n",

      "1. Field of the Invention This invention relates generally to a spinal plating system for use with modular polyaxial pedicle screws. More particularly, the present invention relates to a modular plating assembly which receives modular polyaxial screws, and which may thereby be attached to the posterior or anterior-lateral surfaces of the vertebral column to immobilize the same. 2. Description of the Prior Art The bones and connective tissue of an adult human spinal column consists of more than 20 discrete bones coupled sequentially to one another by a tri-joint complex which consist of an anterior disc and the two posterior facet joints, the anterior discs of adjacent bones being cushioned by cartilage spacers referred to as intervertebral discs. This structure houses and protects critical elements of the nervous system while also having innumerable peripheral nerves and circulatory bodies in close proximity. In spite of these complexities, the spine is a highly flexible structure, capable of a high degree of curvature and twist in nearly every direction. Genetic or developmental irregularities, trauma, chronic stress, tumors, and disease, however, can result in spinal pathologies which either limit this range of motion and/or threaten the critical elements of the nervous system housed within the spinal column. A variety of systems have been disclosed in the art which achieve this immobilization by implanting artificial assemblies in or on the spinal column. These implant systems generally comprise multiple screws which are inserted into sequential vertebral bones, which screws are then rigidly coupled together with a rod or plate. It has been identified, however, that patient anatomy often necessitates the insertion of the screws at non-parallel relative alignments. If the heads of the screws are not flexible, it is correspondingly difficult to contour the rods or plates to seat on, or in the heads of the screws. The art, therefore, contains a variety of attempts at providing instrumentation which purports to permit enhanced freedom for the surgeon with respect to aligning the screw and the rod. Most, however, are complex, inadequately reliable, and lack long-term durability. In addition, most generally lack the feature of being constructed to suit the specific anatomical requirements of every patient's spine. One system which has sucessfully achieved the ease of use and reliability necessary for superior surgical use is the Modular Polyaxial Screw designs disclosed in U.S. patent applications U.S. Ser. Nos. 08/728,017, and 08/799,720, each entitled \"\"A Modular Polyaxial Pedicle Screw\"\", the disclosures of each being hereby incorporated by reference. It is, therefore, the principal object of the present invention to provide a modular plating system which may be utilized in conjunction with the above cited modular polyaxial pedicle screws and the like. In addition, it is an object of the present invention to provide such a plating assembly which effectuates the reduction in surgical time necessary to contour rods and plates for use in spinal immobilization and fusion procedures. Accordingly it is also an object of the present invention to provide plating system which is reliable, durable, and provides long term fixation support. Other objects of the present invention not explicitly stated will be set forth and will be more clearly understood in conjunction with the descriptions of the preferred embodiments disclosed hereafter. The preceding objects are achieved by the present invention which is a modular spinal plating system for use with modular polyaxial locking pedicle screws. More particularly, the spinal plating system comprises an elongate track, consisting of a pair of rails, spaced apart in parallel, coupled at each end. The rails slideably receive, thereabout, a multiplicity of compressible coupling elements. Each compressible coupling element comprises a first through hole into which the parallel rails are inserted in a manner which permits the coupling element to slide along the axial length of the track prior to it being compressed. A second through hole in the coupling element is provided so that it may receive the threaded shaft of a pedicle screw assembly (of the type set forth more specifically in U.S. Ser. Nos. 08/728,017 and 08/799,720, and as also set forth in summary hereinbelow). In addition, the coupling elements each comprise a pair of slots on the outer lateral edges (the edges adjacent to, and laterally containing, the rails of the track element when same is inserted into the coupling element). The slots extend for more than half the axial length of the coupling element, and are directed in opposite directions. These slots permit the coupling element to deflect compressibly upon the application of a compressive force. This deflection causes the coupling element to rigidly lock to the rails. In a preferred embodiment, the modular polyaxial screw comprises: a threaded shaft portion, which is inserted into the vertebral bone, the top of shaft portion including a bowl-shaped socket and a second threading; a stem portion having a threading for receiving a locking nut, the bottom of the stem portion being ball-shaped (a semi-spherical section); and a cylindrical locking cuff which is mounted about the ball-shaped bottom of the stem and threadably secured to the top of the shaft to secure the ball of the stem in the bowl-shaped socket of the shaft. Prior to complete tightening of the cuff, the stem is polyaxially coupled to the shaft. Tightening of the cuff causes the ball-shaped end of the stem to be compression locked in the bowl-shaped socket of the shaft. In accordance with one surgical method which utilizes the present invention, a plurality of such polyaxial pedicle screws are implanted into the vertebral bone, and the stems are roughly positioned to receive the plating system and the cuffs are tightened, thereby locking the stems in place. The appropriate number of compressible coupling elements are then slideably advanced onto the track element (the track element itself may be sized according to the requirements of the surgeon). The coupling elements are aligned in accordance with the positions of the stems, and each of the the stems is then inserted through the second through hole of the corresponding compressible coupling element. It shall be understood that the rials and the openings in the coupling elements which comprise the second through holes are sufficiently contoured to receive stem portions which are not parallel to one another, and not perpendicular to the coupling element itself. A top locking nut is then advanced along the threading of the stem until it contacts the top surface of the compressible coupling element. Continued downward force applied by the nut causes the slots of the coupling element to narrow, and the coupling element to deflect. This deflection causes the coupling element to lock to the rails of the track element, thus completely securing the assembly together.\n",

      "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a sheeting transport apparatus with which a sheet of material to be scanned, namely, sheeting, is transported with two roller pairs in an auxiliary scanning direction for recording an image on the sheeting or reading the image on the sheeting as it is illuminated with light beams. More particularly, the invention relates to the technical field of sheeting transport apparatus in an optical beam scanner that scans sheeting with light beams deflected or aligned in a one-dimensional direction to record an image on the sheeting (in the case of an image recording apparatus) or read the image recorded on the sheeting (in the case of an image reading apparatus). In current radiation image information reading apparatus, a stimulable phosphor sheet having radiation energy stored therein as image information is illuminated with exciting light such as laser light so that the stored radiation energy is emitted to produce photo-stimulated luminescence, which is detected with a photodetector such as a photomultiplier to read the radiation image information photoelectrically. For two-dimensional reading of the radiation image information stored in the stimulable phosphor sheet, the optical beam scanner in the radiation image information reading apparatus performs main scanning of the sheet with one-dimensionally deflected laser light as it is transported in an auxiliary scanning direction generally perpendicular to the main scanning direction. A mechanism commonly used in the optical beam scanner to transport the stimulable phosphor sheet or other types of sheeting in an auxiliary scanning direction is a sheeting transport apparatus that employs two roller pairs spaced apart by a distance shorter than the length of the sheeting in the auxiliary scanning direction (see, for example, Unexamined Published Japanese Patent Application (kokai) Nos. 135064/1987, 167150/1987 and 67859/1988). In the sheeting transport apparatus, the sheeting such as a stimulable phosphor sheet often receives an impact when it goes into or emerges from a pair of rollers. To avoid this problem, one of the two rollers in pair, namely, a nip roller, is brought out of engagement with the other (fixed roller) when the sheeting goes into or emerges from the roller pair. By thusly avoiding the occurrence of impacts on the sheeting, the latter is prevented from vibrating or being offset in position and, as a result, the sheeting is transported in an auxiliary scanning direction smoothly and precisely enough to enable precise reading of the image information. According to commonly assigned Unexamined Published Japanese Patent Application (kokai) No. 281635/1993, there is disclosed an improved mechanism for transporting sheeting in an auxiliary scanning direction using two such roller pairs and it is a compact sheeting transport apparatus of simple construction that uses a single actuator to have the nip roller disengaged from the fixed roller either when the sheeting goes into the roller pair or when it emerges from the roller pair. In the image recording art, there are used photoprinters with which the images recorded on photographic films such as negatives and reversals (which are hereinafter referred to simply as \"\"films\"\") are printed on light-sensitive materials such as photographic paper and later developed to produce finished photographic prints. Such photoprinters have heretofore been of an analog type that performs areal exposure (direct exposure) of the film image by projecting it onto the light-sensitive material. The assignee has recently commercialized a digital photoprinter which operates in the following manner: the film image is read photoelectrically with an image sensor such as CCD in an image reading apparatus such as a scanner, converted to digital image data which is then subjected to specified image processing schemes in an image processing apparatus; in the optical beam scanner in an image recording apparatus (printing apparatus), a light-sensitive material is scan exposed with recording light beams modulated in accordance with the processed digital image data to record an image (latent image), subjected to development and other necessary treatments with a developing apparatus and output as a finished photographic print. In the digital photoprinter, the film image is read photoelectrically, converted to digital image information (data) and thereafter subjected to digital image processing in which tonal correction and other schemes are performed to determine the exposing conditions. Therefore, by digital image processing, not only jobs of editing printed images such as assembling a plurality of images and splitting a single image into two or more images but also various image processing schemes such as color/density adjustments, edge enhancement, dodging, peripheral luminance correction, the correction of distortion and the correction of chromatic aberrations can be performed in any desired manner to output prints that meet specific needs of the user. In addition, the image data about the printed images can be supplied to a computer and other processing equipment or stored in recording media such as a floppy disk. Another advantage of the digital photoprinter is that it is capable of outputting prints of better image quality than those produced by the conventional direct exposure technique in various aspects including resolution, the fidelity in color/density reproduction, and so forth. Despite these desirable features, the digital photoprinter developed by the assignee has problems. In the image printing apparatus used as an image recorder, a web of light-sensitive material is unreeled and transported in an auxiliary scanning direction as it is repeatedly subjected to main scanning with one-dimensionally deflected light beams so that a number of images are recorded on the uninterrupted length of the light-sensitive material. The exposed light-sensitive material is also developed in a continuous form and finally cut to a specified, image-dependent length, thereby producing discrete finished prints. This approach is capable of volume processing in a very high efficiency. On the other hand, the system is so bulky that small-lot processing can only be accomplished with considerable difficulty. What is more, the system is too expensive and bulky to be suitable for use in small-lot processing. Under the circumstances, there is a strong need for a printing apparatus that can be used with the digital photoprinter such that a web of light-sensitive material is cut to discrete sheets of a print-dependent length and thereafter scan exposed with light beams. The printing apparatus (which is hereunder referred to as a \"\"sheet-fed image recording apparatus\"\") allows for realizing a smaller system and considerable reduction in the equipment and running costs. One may contemplate operating the sheet-fed image recording apparatus with the sheeting transport apparatus described in Unexamined Published Japanese Patent Application (kokai) No. 281635/1993, supra, that employs two roller pairs and which is used as a mechanism for transporting sheets in an auxiliary scanning direction in an optical beam scanner in a radiation image information reading apparatus. In the sheet-fed image recording apparatus, a web of light-sensitive material is unreeled and cut to sheets of a given length; therefore, the individual sheets of light-sensitive material are not completely flat but \"\"curl\"\" to some extent. Since the light-sensitive material in a cassette is commonly wound up in roll form with the emulsion-coated side facing outward, a convex curl remains with the emulsion-coated side facing outward after the light-sensitive material has been cut to sheets. Suppose that such \"\"curling\"\" sheets of light-sensitive material are transported in an auxiliary scanning direction with the sheeting transport apparatus described in Unexamined Published Japanese Patent Application (kokai) No. 281635/1993, supra that employs two spaced roller pairs. If each sheet of light-sensitive material is exposed imagewise starting at its advancing end, imagewise scan exposure is performed in the image recording (exposing) position between the roller pairs as the sheet is transported in the auxiliary scanning direction in a so-called \"\"cantilevered\"\" state (it is nipped by either the upstream or downstream roller pair) in the following two periods, one taken for the advancing end of the sheet to pass through the upstream roller pair and the exposing position to reach the downstream roller pair and the other period taken for the trailing end of the sheet to pass through the upstream roller pair and the exposing position to reach the downstream roller pair. As a consequence, both the advancing and trailing end portions of the curling light-sensitive material experience variations in the optical pathlength in the depth direction, which result in exposure unevenness, hence, density unevenness. In other words, the sheeting transport apparatus under discussion is capable of reducing to some extent the exposure unevenness (density unevenness) due to load variations such as impact, vibration and positional offset that occur when the sheet of light-sensitive material goes into or emerges from a pair of rollers. However, the apparatus is not primarily intended to prevent the occurrence of curl in the light-sensitive material which is sheeting to be scanned and, hence, it cannot be maintained completely flat in the exposing position. As a result, the problem of exposure unevenness persists. In short, if two roller pairs used to transport sheets of light-sensitive material are spaced apart by a large distance, more of the light-sensitive material in sheet form is \"\"cantilevered\"\" during transport and any curl that is inherent in it becomes correspondingly pronounced in the exposing position, causing scan exposure of the curling and elevated area of the sheet and making impossible to achieve exposure in a uniform and appropriate optical pathlength. As a result, exposure unevenness tends to occur in both the advancing and trailing end portions of the light-sensitive material, making it difficult to obtain prints of high image quality. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention has been accomplished under these circumstances and has as an object providing a small, compact and low-cost sheeting transport apparatus that is simple in configuration and which yet is optimal for precise image reading and recording purposes. The apparatus uses two roller pairs as a component of an auxiliary scan transport mechanism in optical beam scanners and with this apparatus, sheeting or sheets to be scanned such as light-sensitive material in sheet form can be transported smoothly and precisely in an auxiliary scanning direction. In addition, the apparatus is capable of suppressing the adverse effects of curl and other undesirable phenomena in the sheeting; namely, any positional offsets in the depth direction, such as upward departure from the light scanning position that occurs in the advancing and trailing end portions of the sheeting due to curl and other undesirable effects are eliminated or reduced to a very small tolerable limit, thereby ensuring that the sheeting is maintained adequately flat during transport in the auxiliary scanning direction. This object of the invention can be attained by a sheeting transport apparatus that transports a sheeting on which is performed optical scan in a one-dimensional direction in an auxiliary scanning direction generally perpendicular to the one-dimensional direction, comprising: a first roller pair and a second roller pair that are spaced apart by a distance shorter than a length of the sheeting in the auxiliary scanning direction, wherein the sheeting is transported in the auxiliary scanning direction as it is nipped by the first roller pair and the second roller pair; and an anti-positional offset mechanism that is provided between the first and second roller pairs to ensure that the sheeting has no positional offset from an optical scan position in which the sheeting is scanned optically in a depth direction. In a preferred embodiment, the anti-positional offset mechanism is provided between the first and second roller pairs at least one of upstream and downstream of the optical scan position of the sheeting. In a further preferred embodiment, the anti-positional offset mechanism is provided between the first and second roller pairs upstream of the optical scan position of the sheeting. The present invention also provides the sheeting transport apparatus that further comprises: an optical scan guide that is provided between the first and second roller pairs to support the sheeting in the optical scan position from its underside, wherein the anti-positional offset mechanism prevents upward departure of the sheeting from the optical scan guide.
